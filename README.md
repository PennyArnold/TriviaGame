Frasier Trivia Game - Answers must be given within a certain timeframe.

This is a trivia game that requires the user to select an answer from 4 possible options within a 10-second timeframe.  If the user guesses the correct answer within 10 seconds, the user's score increases by one.  If the user guesses the incorrect answer, the wrong answer increases by one. After the user guesses an answer, the correct answer displays and indicates to the user whether they guessed correctly or incorrectly as an image displays that supports the correct answer.  The game will loop through 10 questions and at the end of the 10 questions, the game is over and the score displays the number of correct and incorrect answers.
